To Whom it May Concern:

Please find contained the .js files for the back-end and front-end services.
Regardless of the outcome, I want to thank you for the opportunity to test myself.
I have never written in javascript before so this was a fun and challening exercise to build something new.

All the best,

Rhett Bulkley




TODO:

FRONT-END

[]Build UI using vue.js and Nuxt.js frameworks

-[x]index page with welcome signage

-[x]game page input box and check button

-[/x] scripts to call heroku API /word and store in backend

-[]game page input box script to only allow characters found in the GET /word from heroku

-[]messagebox or move to ./restart web page which will call a script to reload web page then on "yes" return to game page on "no" return to ./index (welcome) page

BACK-END

[]Build out Backend for storage of users responses in array presented to front-end

[]Build out random scrambler

-[]something like an rand function using a for loop that takes the index of each ASCII character and reassigns it a number from another index object

[]Build API for responses from the backend to alleviate load on front-end and avoid scripts there

[]Build remaining scripts for functionality (check user input)
